[01:00.51] 
[00:49.10] Can I kick it?
[00:50.76] To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does
[00:52.93] Before this, did you really know what live was?
[00:55.33] Comprehend to the track, for it's why 'cause
[00:57.75] Getting measures on the tip of the vibers
[01:00.19] Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
[01:02.55] Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
[01:05.19] If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug
[01:28.69] 
[01:07.84] Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
[01:10.24] Afrocentric living is a big shrug
[01:12.69] A life filled with fun, that's what I love
[01:15.09] A lower plateau is what we're above
[01:17.96] If you diss us, we won't even think of
[01:20.35] Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?
[01:22.72] This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
[01:25.73] Like a box of positives is a plus, love
[01:27.86] As the Tribe flies high like a dove
[01:45.36] 
[01:39.35] (Can I kick it?)
[01:47.35] 
[01:49.75] (Can I kick it?)

[02:28.66] Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
[02:31.38] Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
[02:34.08] Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
[02:36.42] Well, I'm gone (go on then!)
[02:50.42] 
[02:38.82] Can I kick it? To my gribe that flows in layers
[02:43.27] Right now, Phife is a poem sayer
[02:45.37] At times, I'm a studio conveyor
[02:46.95] Mr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?
[02:49.36] You'll be doing us a really big favor
[02:52.01] Boy this track really has a lot of flavor
[02:54.16] When it comes to rhythms, Quest is your savior
[02:56.88] Follow us for the funky behavior
[03:12.88] 
[02:59.26] Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
[03:01.65] Feel free, drop your pants, check your hair
[03:04.53] Do you like the garments that we wear?
[03:06.94] I instruct you to be the obeyer
[03:09.31] A rhythm recipe that you'll savor
[03:11.79] Doesn't matter if you're minor or major
[03:13.95] Yes, the tribe of the game, rhythm player
[03:17.49] As you inhale like a breath of fresh air
[03:37.49] 
[03:27.64] (Can I kick it?)
[03:35.64] 
[03:36.99] (Can I kick it?)
