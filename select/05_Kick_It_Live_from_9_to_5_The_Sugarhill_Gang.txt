[Horns and clapping]
We're jammin to the beat
Gotcha comin' in from out the streets
Let's cram the jam with the homeboy
And the fly girls lookin' sweet
Cause we can party from 9 to 5
Doesn't matter when you arrive
Aye, as long as when you come
You'll have some fun
And kick it live
So everybody just clap ya hands
Hey girl you better grab a man
You can make the last dime

So everybody get up

And get up and jam!
